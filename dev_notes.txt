Today (december 19th)
-modified the code for the arduino board to allow multiple servos to be connected to pins 9 10 and 11
-created a new UI, and segmented each of the buttons to control an individual pin

TODO: 
-buy some more SG90 servos and connect them to test the other functions
-repair 3d printer to begin prototyping to create a housing for the servos
-remember to change servo speed back to 1 in final product :|
